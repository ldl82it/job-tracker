# Job Tracker

A simple job application tracker built with vanilla JavaScript.

This project is part of a study path focused on improving JavaScript fundamentals and building a clean, portfolio-ready application without frameworks.

## Features

- Display a list of job applications
- Add new applications via a form
- Client-side validation of user input

## Project status

Work in progress.

Planned next steps:
- Add delete functionality
- Edit existing applications
- Persist data using localStorage
- Improve UI and styling
- Replace prompt() editing with an HTML modal form (validated inputs for status/date)
